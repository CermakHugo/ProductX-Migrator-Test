I'm happy to help you with your request. However, I noticed that the instructions mention generating a file with a .js extension, but the task description mentions writing .NET Core code. .NET Core is typically written in C# or F#, not JavaScript.

Assuming the task is to generate a C# file, here is the code for the PreferencesService class:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using System;

namespace Services
{
    public class PreferencesService
    {
        private readonly IPreferences _preferences;

        public PreferencesService(IPreferences preferences)
        {
            _preferences = preferences;
        }

        public void SetValue(string key, string value)
        {
            _preferences.SetValue(key, value);
        }
    }

    public interface IPreferences
    {
        void SetValue(string key, string value);
    }

    public class Preferences : IPreferences
    {
        private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

        public Preferences(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            _configuration = configuration;
        }

        public void SetValue(string key, string value)
        {
            _configuration[key] = value;
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that this implementation uses the `IConfiguration` interface from the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` namespace to store the preferences. You may need to adjust this to fit your specific requirements.

Also, I've included a basic implementation of the `IPreferences` interface in the `Preferences` class. You may want to modify this to suit your needs.

Let me know if this meets your requirements or if you need further assistance!
