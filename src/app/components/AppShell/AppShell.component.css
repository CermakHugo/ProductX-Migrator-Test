Since there is no component template provided, I will create the CSS file from scratch based on the solution design.

Here is the generated CSS code for the AppShell component:

```
.AppShell {
  /* Add styles for the AppShell instance here */
}

.AppShell-header {
  /* Add styles for the header section here */
}

.AppShell-content {
  /* Add styles for the content section here */
}

.AppShell-footer {
  /* Add styles for the footer section here */
}
```

Please note that this is a basic structure, and you may need to add more styles and selectors based on your specific requirements.
